I've been wanting to try a new programming 
language for me for a long time. Considering 
the fact that I like to create complex projects, 
I decided to try to develop a matrix calculator on it.

Primitive, simple, unoptimized code and inelegant solutions. 
I just started learning this language, so I'm sorry. But it's fun!
